			<li1><div class="">In the world:
		<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

			A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. This is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.
			
			This course provides a general introduction to COVID-19 and emerging respiratory viruses and is intended for public health professionals, incident managers and personnel working for the United Nations, international organizations and NGOs.
			
			As the official disease name was established after material creation, any mention of nCoV refers to COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.</p>

	</li1>
		
			<li1>In Tunisia:	
		<p>Tunisia confirmed its first case on 2 March 2020, with the victim being a 40-year-old Tunisian man from Gafsa returning from Italy
			In addition, 74 suspected cases in Gafsa have been placed under home confinement.Two of the suspected cases violated the confinement measures, and the local health directorate decided to take legal action against them.
In March there were 394 confirmed cases, 10 deaths and 3 recovered patients. The number of active cases at the end of the month was 381.
